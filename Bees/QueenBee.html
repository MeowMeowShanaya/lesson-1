    <h1>Queen bee</h1>
    <p>Each beehive must have a queen to keep the hive well stocked with new bees. Her sole job is to lay eggs. Other bees are needed to do everything else regarding the maintenance of the hive, the production of honey and the care of the queen. The queen needs bees to mate with (drones), bring her food and clean up after her (workers).</p>
    <p>
        The queen bee is the largest of all the bees in a hive. Her main job is to lay eggs and she can lay around 1500-2000 eggs a day at her prime. However this is not everyday of her life – there are some days she won’t lay any.
