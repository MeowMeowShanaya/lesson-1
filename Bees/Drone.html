    <H1>Drone Bees</H1>
    <P>Drones are all male bees that have only one purpose in the hive. Their only job is to mate with the queen to help her produce offspring. Unfortunately, this is a thankless task, as the queen will effectively kill all drones she mates with by removing the drones’ sexual organs in order to store their sperm within her body. Consequently, drones that are not favored by the queen for mating don’t get an easy ride. These rejected suitors will be forced out by the other bees of the hive during the winter, having been deemed worthless by the hive’s standards. Tough life…</P>

<P>Spring and summer is the time drone bees pop up. They are much larger then the worker bees and are also all male. Drones will not collect food. Their sole purpose is to breed with the queen. However only 6-8 drones actually breed with her. Their lifespan is a little longer than the worker bee (in the summer – worker bees can survive the winter), being around 2 months. Once fall hits they are ejected from the hive by worker bees. Drones can not kill or hurt anything – they are just used for their seed.</P>
